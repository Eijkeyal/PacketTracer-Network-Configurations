# Cisco Packet Tracer - Network Configurations

This repository contains Cisco Packet Tracer network simulations demonstrating various networking concepts and configurations.

## 📁 Project Contents

### 🔧 Configurations Implemented
- **Static Routing** - Manual route configuration between networks
- **DHCP Server** - Dynamic IP address allocation for client devices
- **Web Server** - HTTP service hosting and accessibility testing
- **DNS Server** - Domain name resolution and record management
- **Network Topologies** - Various network design layouts

### 🛠️ Network Components Used
- **Routers** - Inter-network communication and routing
- **Switches** - LAN segmentation and frame forwarding
- **Hubs** - Basic network connectivity
- **Routing Cables** - Serial and Ethernet connections
- **End Devices** - PCs, servers, and network devices

## 🌐 Network Topologies

### Topology 1: Basic Enterprise Networks
[Internet] -- [Router] -- [Switch] -- [PCs]
|
[DHCP Server]
[DNS Server]
[Web Server]

### Topology 2: Multi-Router Static Routing
[Network A] -- [Router 1] -- [Router 2] -- [Network B]
| |
[Server Farm] [Client LAN]

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Static Routing
- Configured manual routes between different networks
- Implemented route redistribution where necessary
- Verified connectivity with ping and traceroute tests

### DHCP Services
- Set up DHCP pools for multiple subnets
- Configured IP address ranges and exclusions
- Implemented lease times and DNS server assignments
### Web Server
- Configured HTTP services on dedicated server
- Set up default web pages for testing
- Verified accessibility from client PCs

### DNS Services
- Created forward and reverse lookup zones
- Configured A records, CNAME records, and MX records
- Tested name resolution across the network
## 🚀 How to Use These Files

1. **Open in Cisco Packet Tracer**
   - Download the `.pkt` files
   - Open with Cisco Packet Tracer 7.x or higher

2. **Test Configurations**
   - Use simulation mode to see packet flow
   - Test connectivity between devices
   - Verify services are working properly

3. **Modify and Learn**
   - Experiment with different IP schemes
   - Add new services or devices
   - Practice troubleshooting techniques
